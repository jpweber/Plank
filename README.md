# Plank
## Description
Plank is a simple load generates set of tools. This was originally created for benchmarking ec2 instances to see if there is a noisy neighbor problem and terminate and launch another one if needed. 

What this is and what it's not. This set of tests is not to provide anything particularly telling about a system. What it is, is a set of tests that can be ran with the same parameters on systems. It is intended that you know what a _good_ system is and you keep the results of these tests as a _good_ result. You then run the same tests on future machines to make sure they are not worse than your â€¦ _benchmark_
